## AWS Account Setup
- This is largely GUI/console based
- https://github.com/WildWestTech/aws-infra/blob/main/AccountSetup.md

## Install AWS CLI
- We'll need the AWS command line interface tool for interacting with AWS resources
- https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

## Install Terraform
- Once we have an AWS account setup and we have AWS CLI installed, we can start developing our infrastructure as code, via terraform
